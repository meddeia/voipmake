# VoIP
Chat with your friends using Voice over IP. VoIP makes it possible to transfer audio over a network in real time.

## Usage
Start by running the server. Then configure it with your IP address. All users that want to chat together need to start the client and connect to the server's IP address. After that, you can chat with each other using VoIP.

**Note:** no echo-cancellation has been implemented yet. Hence, you will hear your own voice as an echo when your speaker is too loud or near your microphone.
